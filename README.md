# MOJITO

A suite of python tools and bash scripts to construct and analyze sea-ice deformation rates out of simulated or observed Lagrangian sea-ice trajectories.

Dependency:  package [`sitrack`]() (script `si3_part_tracker.py`), to perform the seeding of RGPS or user-defined cloud of points and track these points based on the sea-ice velocity read into output netCDF files generated by SI3.


### Test directories

* `TEST_rgps`: contains scripts to extract relevant data and build deformations out of RGPS data (`sitrack` not needed as the data is already Lagrangian)

* `TEST_tracking`: contains scripts to build deformations out of hourly SI3 sea-ice velocity data, using the same points/quadrangles as those extracted out of RGPS data (for comparison between SI3 and RGPS data)

* `TEST_si3`: simply seeds points according to your needs (extent, density, etc) and track them using SI3 sea-ice velocity data (no RGPS/observations involved, simply creates Lagrangian data out of SI3 output)
